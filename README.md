# React Week 03 Review

## Install instructions
* Clone repo to your local computer

`$ git clone https://github.com/kingluddite/react-week-03-review`

* I recommend setting up GitHub with ssh
  * [youtube tutorial how to set up ssh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3ELWci34cM&t=164s)
  * [beginner tutorial how to use Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&t=1466s)

### Install dependencies
`$ npm i`

### npm vs yarn
* Either works
* I prefer `npm` and use it in this review

## Removing Code we don't need from Create React App
* It's useful code but when learning React Essentials I find removing it helps

## Next - Class Based components
